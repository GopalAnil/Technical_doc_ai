        The system uses a two-stage approach:
        
        1. **Document Classification**: A fine-tuned DistilBERT model identifies the appropriate document type based on input text. This model was trained on a custom dataset of technical documentation examples across various categories.
        
        2. **Content Generation**: A fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model generates content using specialized prompts for each document section. The system uses template-based prompt engineering to ensure consistent and comprehensive outputs.
        
        Prompt templates are carefully designed for each document type to ensure the generated content follows industry best practices and is structured appropriately.

        ### 1. Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)
        The easiest way to deploy this app is using Streamlit Cloud:
        
        1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
        2. Sign up at [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
        3. Create a new app by connecting to your GitHub repository
        4. Configure the app to run `src/app.py`
        
        ### 2. Heroku Deployment
        To deploy on Heroku:
        
        1. Create a `Procfile` with: `web: streamlit run src/app.py --server.port=$PORT`
        2. Add a `setup.sh` file with Streamlit configuration
        3. Follow Heroku deployment instructions
        
        ### 3. Local Server with Ngrok
        For a quick demo or presentation:
        
        1. Run the app locally: `streamlit run src/app.py`
        2. Install ngrok: `pip install pyngrok`
        3. Create a tunnel: `ngrok http 8501`
        4. Share the provided public URL
